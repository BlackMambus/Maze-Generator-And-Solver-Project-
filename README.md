# Maze-Generator-And-Solver-Project-

This project explores the fascinating world of algorithmic problem-solving by building a system that can create and solve mazes. It combines the art of labyrinth design with powerful pathfinding strategies, providing both a challenging and visually engaging experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Maze Generation:

Automatically creates mazes of varying sizes and complexity

Supports multiple algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim's, or Kruskal's for random, perfect mazes

Visual representation of the maze grid or graph structure

Maze Solving:

Finds the shortest or optimal path from entrance to exit

Utilizes algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), A*, or Dijkstra's

Highlights visited paths and the final solution

User Interface:

Interactive GUI for customizing maze parameters

Option to manually create or edit mazes

Visual step-by-step animation of pathfinding process
